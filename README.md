# Podkicker_Podcast_OPML_Krunching
Using an OPML file generated by Podkicker Pro, go through each podcast, remove unnecessary podcasts, recreate OPML file for importing

Potential changes:
Could strip the podcasts line down directly to podcast URL only and recreate the whole line again in Step 2. 
This would be easy enough, but I'm a little bit loathe to strip the string 3 times (or even 4) to get down to the pure link.
